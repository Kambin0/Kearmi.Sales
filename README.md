I have designed and implemented this database system with the purpose of providing support to a friend's online reselling business. The primary aim of this system is to optimize efficiency and provide data to enhance decision-making. By incorporating multiple tables for customer information, product details, supplier records, and sales data, the database effectively handles data storage and analysis. This database provides information for business strategies to drive success.
